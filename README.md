### ⚙️ My Projects 

1)SAVE EARTH {Completed}
  
  Save Earth is simple 2d space shooter game created in unity for GameOff Gamejam.
  The source of the game is available: [github](https://github.com/MKDev121/SaveEarth) .
  Feel free to edit and enhance the game :)

2)Endless Turn Based Python Game {In Development}

  Working on an endless turned based 2d game created in python using pygame.
  Mostly all the assets used in the game will be created by me using open source tools like Aesprite,Bosca Ceoil,Gimp etc..
  The game will be set in the world war era, where you, the player, have to defend your base from enemy attack using your units—soldiers, turrets, tanks, airplanes, and bombs.
  After finishing the first version of the game, I will make the source public so that other passionate game developers can also work on it and improve the game.

3)LINEAR EQUATION SOLVER APP {ON HOLD}
  
  Currently working on a Desktop Apllication which can solve N linear equations of N independent variables using python and PyQt.
